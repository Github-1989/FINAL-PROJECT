**Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used to make predictions or to explain the relationship between two variables. Dependent Variable – Current population, Independent Variable – Area, land area, density, growth rate**


**However, predicting the world population in 2023 would require information about various factors such as birth rates, death rates, immigration rates, and other socio-economic factors that are subject to change over time. These changes cannot be accurately predicted using a linear regression model.Two major sources that assess and publish global population are: the United Nations and the U.S. Census Bureau**


**The United Nations Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs every two years calculates, updates, and publishes estimates of total population in its World Population Prospects series. These population estimates and projections provide the standard and consistent set of population figures that are used throughout the United Nations system**
**o	Present Dataset contains list of 205 countries including dependent territories.Dependent territory also known as dependent area, or dependency or an external territory is a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside the controlling state's integral area.Rank allocated to each country and dependencies are according to their population size by United Nations**


**Dataset contains nine columns which hold information for each country and dependent territory. Primary aim of data preparation and cleaning is to enhance the quality of dataset. Followings steps will be employed here**


**1.	Replacing or removing missing value based on the initial investigation by deploying isna()/drpna()/fillna() methods**


**2.	Finding duplicate values by employing duplicated () and drop duplicate() methods**


**3.	Dropping unnecessary columns using drop() method**


**4.	Sorting of index for improving the performance by deploying sort_index() method**


**5.	Converting column names into title case using .str.title or apply() methods**


**6.	Renaming column name by using raname() method**


**7.	Replacing certain characters using .str.replace() method to convert them into numeric values**


**8.	Updating row values using .loc() accessor**


**o	Checking datatypes of columns after conversion**


**1.	Exploratory data analysis is a vital component through which we explore and extract valuable insights and hidden patterns in a dataset**


**2.	It employs Descriptive analysis and visualization methods**


**Following points can be inferred**


**1.	Dataset contains facts and figures regarding population of 205 countries and dependencies for Years 2022 and 2023**


**2.	Rank to each country is assigned as per their population**


**3.	Country with rank 1 is designated as most populous country**


**4.	Growth rate ranges from -7.45 to 4.92**


**5.	Positive growth rate denotes increase in population**


**6.	Negative growth rate signifies that a population size of a particular country got smaller**


**7.	Most crowded country accounts for 17.85 percentage of world's total population**
